| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Command | `/askfaq` (or another name) |
| Request URL | `https://<your-api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/slack` (the endpoint from **API Gateway** you created earlier.) |
| Short Description | "AWS chatbot" |
| Usage Hint | `[your question]` (e.g.: "`/askfaq What is aws?`") |
